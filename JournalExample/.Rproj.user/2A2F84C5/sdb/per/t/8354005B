The edition I have examined here is from the 1968 edition published by the American Folklore Society ({PROPP} et al. (1968)). The book is a classic of Russian Formalist thinking. Propp’s primary goal in the book is to analyze plot and he does this by describing a series of what he terms functions. Propp is intent on developing a classification system for plot movement and so he begins with a general discussion of prior work in this area. Ultimately he argues that the prior work is a mess for being far too subjectively derived and too open to contradiction.\nHe then sets out to develop a new classification system based on the linear sequence of plot elements or functions he sets out to describe. These are essentially structural elements. Propp would be criticized later for ignoring context (cultural and lexical) (see Claude Levi-Strauss in Propp and Liberman (1984)). These functions are closely tied to characters and in the course of describing the functions in the plot, Propp outlines a set of archetypal characters who are each attached to one or more of the various functions. Propp identifies seven broad character types as follows:\n1. The donor\n2. The hero\n3. The villain\n4. The dispatcher\n5. The helper\n6. The prize–usually a princess who the hero marries/acquires to conclude the story.\n7. The false hero\n{“In} addition,” writes Propp, “there exist special personages for connections (complainers, informers, slanderers).” These I think we might rightly call the minor characters.\nChapter {VIII} deals with character most directly. Propp begins by noting: {“The} study of characters according to their functions, their distribution into categories, and their forms of appearance inevitably leads us to the problem of tale characters in general. Previously, we sharply separated the question of who acts in the tale from the questions of the actions themselves. The nomenclature and attributes of the characters are variable. . . By attributes we mean the . . . external qualities of the characters: their age, sex, status, external appearance, peculiarities of this appearance, and so forth.”\nThe qualities of each of these characters are referred to as “attributes”: {“By} attributes we mean the totality of all the external qualities of the characters: their age, sex, status, external appearance, and so forth.” He goes on to write that {“The} study of a character’s attributes establishes on the following three basic headings: external appearance and nomenclature, particularities of introduction into the narrative, and dwelling place. To these are added a series of other, less significant, auxiliary elements.”}\n},\n\n@article{moretti_operationalizing:_2013,\n\ttitle = {Operationalizing: or, the Function of Measurement in Modern Literary Study},\n\tlanguage = {English},\n\tnumber = {84},\n\tjournal = {New Left Review },\n\tauthor = {Moretti, Franco},\n\tmonth = dec,\n\tyear = {2013},\n\tkeywords = {Digital Humanities, Literary Criticism / European / English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh},\n\tpages = {103--119}\n},\n\n@book{campbell_hero_2008-1,\n\ttitle = {The Hero with a Thousand Faces},\n\tisbn = {9781577315933},\n\tabstract = {Since its release in 1949, The Hero with a Thousand Faces has influenced millions of readers by combining the insights of modern psychology with Joseph Campbell’s revolutionary understanding of comparative mythology.

Alex Woloch uses this simple question to develop a powerful new theory of the realist novel, based on how narratives distribute limited attention among a crowded field of characters. His argument has important implications for both literary studies and narrative theory. Characterization has long been a troubled and neglected problem within literary theory. Through close readings of such novels as Pride and Prejudice, Great Expectations, and Le Père Goriot, Woloch demonstrates that the representation of any character takes place within a shifting field of narrative attention and obscurity. Each individual--whether the central figure or a radically subordinated one--emerges as a character only through his or her distinct and contingent space within the narrative as a whole. The \"character-space,\" as Woloch defines it, marks the dramatic interaction between an implied person and his or her delimited position within a narrative structure. The organization of, and clashes between, many character-spaces within a single narrative totality is essential to the novel's very achievement and concerns, striking at issues central to narrative poetics, the aesthetics of realism, and the dynamics of literary representation. Woloch's discussion of character-space allows for a different history of the novel and a new definition of characterization itself. By making the implied person indispensable to our understanding of literary form, this book offers a forward-looking avenue for contemporary narrative theory.},\n\tlanguage = {en},\n\tpublisher = {Princeton University Press},\n\tauthor = {Woloch, Alex},\n\tmonth = feb,\n\tyear = {2009},\n\tkeywords = {Literary Criticism / European / English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh, Literary Criticism / Semiotics \\& Theory}\n},\n\n@article{murray_plot_1916,\n\ttitle = {Plot and Character in Greek Tragedy},\n\tvolume = {47},\n\tdoi = {doi:10.2307/282827},\n\tabstract = {The article was published in 1916, which is quite dated compared to the other readings that are being reviewed. Additionally, the article doesn't seem very helpful in terms of addressing possible methodologies or insight into character development within  fiction. Murray is mainly focused on the comparison between Greek and Shakespearean drama, as well as the restrictions that are placed on each. Contradicting Aristotle's Poetics, Murray begins by suggesting that character is more important than plot (a reader would remember the\ncharacter of Macbeth without remembering the exact plot of the drama.\nMurray then depicts the ways in which Greek tragedy was dictated by outside\ninfluences. Among these are the necessity for the inspiration of the protagonist to be drawn from heroic legend; the actual number of lines in the play in which character could be developed (Greek tragedies had a fraction of the lines present\nin Shakespearean plays); and  finally the main point--that Greek characters were manipulated by fate. Murray, along with De Quincey (whom he quotes), suggest that the definition of a character cannot exist when their motives are supplied solely by fate. In De Quencey's words: {\"Man}, no longer the representative of an august will, man the passion-puppet of fate, could not with any effect display what we call character, which is a distinction between man and man, emanating\noriginally from the will, and expressing its determinations, moving under the large variety of human impulses.\"\nMurray concludes, quite obviously, that a character in dramatic tragedy\nmust be compelled by both internal and external forces. He supplies a couple\nof opportunities for further reading, though they all appear to be focused on\ndrama only, which seems to be incompatible with our aspirations in this class.\nSuch authors include Thomas De Quincey, Newman's {\"Poetry}, With Reference to\nAristotle's Poetics,\" Emile Faguet's {\"Drame} Ancien, Drame Modern,\" and Walk-\nley's {\"Dramatic} Criticism.\"},\n\tjournal = {Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association},\n\tauthor = {Murray, Augustus Taber},\n\tyear = {1916},\n\tnote = {{JSTOR} 282827},\n\tpages = {51–64}\n},\n\n@misc{joel_n._shurkin_using_2012,\n\ttype = {Text},\n\ttitle = {Using Social Networks to Analyze the Classics},\n\turl = {http://www.insidescience.org/content/using-social-networks-analyze-classics/747},\n\tabstract = {Harry Potter is fictional, but Achilles and Beowulf -- perhaps not.},\n\tlanguage = {English},\n\turldate = {2014-01-08},\n\tauthor = {Joel N.

But if you work on novels or plays, style is only part of the picture. What about plot – how can that be quantified?

Moretti states at the beginning his intent to explore the idea of quantifying plot, which he believes can be most readily achieved by Network Theory. Moretti breifly and brilliantly describes Network Theory stating;\n\nThis is a theory that studies connections within large groups of ob- jects: the objects can be just about anything banks, neurons, film actors, research papers, friends... and are usually called nodes or vertices; their connections are usually called edges; and the analysis of how vertices are linked by edges has revealed many unexpected features of large systems\n\nCharacter Defined\n\nIn a plot of characters and actions a character will be the vertices of the network, with the interactions being the edges. In Moretti’s article two characters are linked when the two characters have exchanged words which results in a sort of web of interconnected characters. After doing this a few important things arise; “the character that minimized the sum of the distances to all other vertices”. Which of course ends up being the protagonist. So in theory one step in and interact with the plot, removing pivotal vertices and examining the continued or lack of communication between characters. Even, in removing a protagonist character like Hamlet, being able to view the aspects of the plot that are no longer relevant to the story because that key link is not there. In doing this sort of analysis Moretti found that the way literary scholars traditionally think about character does not appear in Network Theory. Major verses minor, round verses flat, Moretti found nothing in the network distributions that upheld these categories leading him to arrive at the idea that traditional character hierarchy needs to be changed.\n\nTechniques, Improvements Problems\n\nThe first improvement and first admitted fault is in the details. Straight out of the gate Moretti addresses his quantitative limitations and lack of mathematical knowledge. This can be seen as a problem but also a valuable technique. The ability to take a step back from numbers and simply look with your eyes eliminates a lot of muddling information which is the kind of theorizing we were doing on the first day. Another admitted fault was that the interactions be- tween characters in his analyses are not weighted. He uses the example that a five word sentence from a Horatio giving an order is weighted the same as a five page dialogue revealing important character or plot information.\n\n1\n\n \n\nThe technique of Network Theory I think can be highly valuable in our journey to discover the archetypal characters because it allows the timeline of a story to be quantified in space. One big hurdle to do this will be also lumping in the nonverbal interactions between characters, which can often be some of the most important actions in a plot. In clearing that jump I believe we will be well on our way to establishing concrete models for characters.\n\nQuotes\n\nAnd the same applies to the binaries with which we usually think about character: protagonist versus minor characters, or round versus flat: nothing in the distribution supports these dichotomies; what it asks for, rather, is a radical reconceptualization of characters and of their hierarchy hierarchy\n\nStyle, integrated within plot as a function of plot Conversely, as we move towards the center of the network figureurality rises, all the way to Hamlets puns in response to Claudius, and to the soliloquies that occupy, so to speak, the center of the center A model for the relationship between what we do, and how we think about it: this is what a plot-style continuum could provide. But we are definitely not there yet.\n\nThe protagonist, yes, but not free.
