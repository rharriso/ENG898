This problem can be broken into several subproblems, first would be determining character existence, second the existance of a relationship between those characters, and thirdly the nature of that relationship. \n\nThe first subproblem is the most quantifiable. Since for many novels a complete, or semi-complete list of characters is available. Success metrics are therefore readily available. The second and third seem more difficult. Defining a correct answer for character relationship existence, much less quality, is much more difficult, if not intractable. \n\nRelationship existance at least seems to have a possible solution, comparing with human created character networks. This has the obvious drawback of being extremely labor intensive in constructing a test set. Therefore, unless such a corpus is readily available, a prudent course of action might be to investigate network creation in a more qualitative manner.\n\n\\section{Character Network Construction}: (January 26, 2014)\n\nCharacter networks can be constructed using dialogue (Elson, Dames McKewon)\nOr by simple coocurence in text (Park, or LOTR project)\n\nLike Park et-al, I'm interested in investigating social changes over time. However, while they intend to divide the text into chapeters, I believe that a more interesting view would be to construct a social graph for any given point in the text. \n\nMy idea is create a web interface that allows the user to upload text and a character list. Then produces a network similar to the one seen on the LOTR project. However, this graph will allow the user to adjust constants.\n\nThe user will also be able to \"scrub throught the text\" viewing the changes in real time. Using statements as the atomic units, the connections made would be further weighted by distance from current position using some kernel. A variety of options could be available:\n* A power function\n* a normal function\n\nThe idea then is to see in \"real time\" the changes in importance and strength of character relationships.\n\nExposing the constants and filters to the end users\n\n\\section{Elson}: (January 27, 2014)\n\n\\ldots get notes off bitbucket \\ldots\n\n\\section{Stanford Papers}: (January 30, 2014)\n\n\\subsection{Baselines and Bigrams: Simple, Good Sentiment and Topic Classification}\n\n2012?\n\nInvestigating performance and efficiency of Naive Bayes (NB), SVM, and Hybrid solutions on Sentiment tasks. NB actually does better. Hybrid can provide new state of the art performance level.\n\nData set includes customer reviews, movie reviews, IMDB, newsgroups.\n\nTokenization was used when available. If not unigrams were created. Non Alphabetical were filtered out. Cross validations splites were observed in several cases. Delta values for p < 0.5 were displayed. \n\nMNB better at snippits. Statistical methods miss some cases in smaller sets. ``Not An Inhumane Monster'', ``Killing Cancer''.  \n\nSVM is better at full-length reviews. When the target of sentiment in a larger body of text then, SVM performs better.\n\nNVSVM espcicially bigram features performed well across the board, large and short sections. ``Often gives better results than previously published'' (trigrams hurts slightly). \n\nUtility? See what features are being used for sentiment analysis when it comes to it. Need to learn more about what features are in the SVMs in general.\n\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{apa}\n\\bibliography{journal}\n\n\\end{document}\n",
