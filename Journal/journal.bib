	abstract = {Recently we witnessed that the social network 
analysis focusing on social entities is applied in the social 
science and web-science, behavioral sciences, as well as in 
economics, marketing. In this paper we present one method 
to construct and structure analysis the social network from 
literary fictions by a simple lexical analysis. And we will 
show that those literary social graphs, shows the power law 
distribution of some features, which is the typical 
characteristics of complex systems. We newly proposed the 
concept of the kernel of literary social network by which we 
can classify the abstract level of protagonists appeared in 
fictions. And we also studied the connectivity of social 
network based on statement distance distribution of 
characters. Our study shows that the metric distance among 
characters written in linear text is very similar to the 
intrinsic and semantic relationship described by fiction 
writers, which implies the proposed social network from 
fictions could be another representation of literary fiction. 
So we can apply other scientific and quantitative approach 
by analyzing the concrete social graph model extracted from 
textual data.
